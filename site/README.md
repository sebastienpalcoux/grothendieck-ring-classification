# Fusion & Grothendieck Ring Atlas

Private research site with two clearly distinguished populations. Its main table counts **confirmed realized Grothendieck rings**, omitting rows that contain only zeros. Partial bands display ≥: the known positive count is a lower bound while unresolved fusion rings remain. The fusion-ring census counts **all** based rings and is linked directly. The categorification ledger keeps exclusions, positive models, and general unresolved cases apart. Multiplicity is the exact maximum structure constant. Only ranks with a classification manuscript and assessed bands are included; counts alone never imply categorifiability.

## Regenerate

Run these commands from this Site checkout, passing the private classification repository as input:

    python3 build_snapshot.py --classification /path/to/classification-repository --classification-commit FULL_RELEASE_COMMIT_SHA
    python3 build_realized.py --classification /path/to/classification-repository
    npm run check
    npm run dev

`build_snapshot.py` rejects missing census bands, cumulative mismatches, and status partitions that do not sum to census counts. `build_realized.py` checks every catalogued tensor's rank, unit, duality and associativity. It derives exact dual and invertibility data and approximate Perron dimensions. For commutative rings it supplies exact codegree polynomials and an exact primitive-root character presentation. For noncommutative models it derives numerical irreducible trace characters from the exact center kernel, checks block dimensions and orthogonality, and attaches exact individual codegree polynomials using the central Casimir and the validated numerical block matching. Numerical values are marked approximations. `smoke_test.py` compares each band’s positive count against the exact model records and requires rank five to be complete through multiplicity twenty. The static site serves only `dist/` and uses no credentials or runtime APIs.

## Private publication

The source and associated GitHub classification repository remain private. The Site uses owner-only access unless the owner invites a viewer through **Share**. Preserve that audience when publishing revised versions.

The rank-three manuscript proves unrestricted five-ring necessity directly, together with sphericality. Its classification-status ledger marks every displayed rank-three multiplicity as complete. By default an individual ring profile shows one fusion matrix at a time and offers a full tensor download. The character page distinguishes exact primitive-root formulas from approximate numerical tables.

## Rank-six classification

The classification counts come from the current release ledger; categorical
models, exact fusion tensors and references come from the model catalogue.
The residual summary starts with the dated rank-six release and applies
`evidence/residual_20261002/rank6/research_progress.json` after verifying its
previous-source checksum and unchanged classification totals. The current
research overlay and PDF addendum preserve the frozen October 1 archive.
The snapshot includes one
current archive, the manuscript and verification guide; superseded public
archives are removed. Validation compares all displayed counts with the
classification ledger and model catalogue and checks the archive and PDF
hashes recorded in `dist/data/atlas.json`.
