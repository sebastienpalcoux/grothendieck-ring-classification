# Rank-8 Grothendieck rings through multiplicity 2

The rank-seven multiplicity-five continuation addresses all 5,805 supplied exact-multiplicity-five rings: 5,804 general exclusions, 1 realization and 0 unresolved cases. The classification of the supplied census is complete through multiplicity 5. The new realization R7_5_5678 is Rep(AGL(1,7)).

The history option checks source-bound dependencies in isolated compatible
snapshots. These continuation checks do not replace the complete base-certificate
loops in the [full replay guide](../../evidence/prepublication_20261017/FULL_REPLAY.md).
Use normal Python for assertion-based checkers. Positive counts in an incomplete
band are lower bounds; a timeout or surviving necessary system proves no exclusion.
